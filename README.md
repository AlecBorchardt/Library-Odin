# Library-Odin
Library page for the Odin Project.

So I went about this project incorrectly (no commits until uploading the whole project) for a reason.
I wanted to focus on what the project was asking me to demonstrate, 
but also how I think about structuring my code and designing layout.
I already know how to commit changes, and since this is a personal project and a team or client isn't waiting on the result,
I didn't feel the need to spend the time. 
In restrospect, this was lazy, and I won't be repeating this mistake in the future.
I learned from this project how to better build out a project, 
how to create and use constructors, and reinforced and built on my html and css skills.
